## 🔧 How to Continue Development

### Starting the Application
```bash
cd healthcare-voice-agent
npm install
npm start
```

### Development Workflow
1. Choose a component from the placeholder list
2. Replace placeholder with full implementation
3. Add proper TypeScript types
4. Implement business logic in services
5. Add validation and error handling
6. Update routing if needed
7. Add tests

### Key Files to Understand
- `src/App.tsx` - Main application with routing and context
- `src/services/` - Business logic and API integrations
- `src/types/index.ts` - TypeScript definitions
- `src/components/` - UI components organized by feature

### Architecture Patterns
- React Context for global state management
- Service layer for business logic
- Type-safe development with TypeScript
- Modular CSS with custom properties
- Secure storage with encryption
